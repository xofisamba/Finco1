"""DSRA Engine - Debt Service Reserve Account with equity funding.

Implements Blueprint S1-5 fix:
- DSRA is funded from EQUITY at Financial Close, not from operating CF
- Initial DSRA is part of the project funding structure
- Operating CF can contribute to DSRA top-up, but initial funding is from equity

Key insight:
- DSRA = 6 months of senior debt service
- For Oborovo: ~2,239 kEUR DSRA funded at FC from equity
- v2 bug: DSRA was "filled" from operating CF in first periods (wrong)
- v3 fix: DSRA initial funding comes from equity, operating CF only tops up

Example for Oborovo:
  Annual senior debt service ≈ 4,478 kEUR (from sculpting)
  DSRA = 6/12 × 4,478 = 2,239 kEUR (funded at FC from equity)

  At FC:
    Required equity = sculpt_capex + DSRA_initial + other reserves
                   = 56,430 + 2,239 + 0 = ~58,669 kEUR

  vs v2 buggy:
    DSRA_initial = 0 (not funded at FC)
    First years of operating CF go to fill DSRA → delayed distributions

v3 fix ensures:
1. DSRA_initial is computed from sculpted debt service, not from operating CF
2. DSRA_initial is part of funding structure (equity contribution at FC)
3. Operating CF only tops up DSRA if balance drops below target

"""Phase 4A SHL engine — straight-line amortization schedule generator.

No sculpting. No capitalization. No circular funding.
Simple deterministic schedule for architectural foundation.

Architecture:
  SPV waterfall
    → dividend upstream
    → SHL interest upstream
    → SHL principal upstream
    → HoldCo aggregation
    → future tax engine
    → future sponsor layer

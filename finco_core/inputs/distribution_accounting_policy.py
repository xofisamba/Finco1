Controls whether the WHT, legal reserve, and accounting-cap second pass

Authority:
    Projects with SOURCE_PROVEN authority have had their dividend accounting
    formulas traced to a workbook source. Projects without this policy
    preserve frozen G2C semantics (gross == net == legal_equity_distribution).

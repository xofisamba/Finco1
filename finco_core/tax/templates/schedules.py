# ── Tax Depreciation Schedule ───────────────────────────────────────────────

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TaxDepreciationPeriod:
    """Single period in a tax depreciation schedule.

    Tracks the difference between book depreciation (for financial statements)
    and tax depreciation (for tax return) for one asset category.

    The ``non_deductible_depreciation_keur`` field captures the **current period's**
    timing difference between book and tax depreciation:
    ``max(0, book_dep - min(book_dep, tax_dep_claimed))``.

    This is NOT the accumulated pool — it is the period delta only.
    The accumulated pool ( ``accumulated_non_deductible_depreciation_keur`` )
    tracks how much timing difference remains to be recovered in future periods.

    For non-deductible assets (rule.deductible=False), tax depreciation is
    always 0 and all book depreciation is permanently non-deductible —
    no timing difference reversal occurs.

    Example — ME infrastructure (2.5% tax cap, 5% accounting, 20-year life):
    - Years 1–20 (book dep = 500 kEUR/yr, tax cap = 250 kEUR/yr):
      Each year creates a 250 kEUR current-period timing difference.
      accumulated grows to 5,000 kEUR by end of year 20.
    - Years 21+ (book dep = 0): tax dep continues to claim from the accumulated
      pool until tax basis reaches zero. accumulated declines as differences
      are recovered; ending accumulated = 0 only when fully recovered.

    Parameters
    ----------
    asset_cost_keur : float
        Original asset cost in thousands of EUR. Must be >= 0.
    book_depreciation_by_period : tuple[float, ...]
        Book depreciation charge (for financial statements) per period in kEUR.

    Returns
    -------
    TaxDepreciationSchedule
        Per-period breakdown of book vs tax depreciation and remaining tax basis.

    Algorithm (for deductible assets)
    ----------------------------------
    For each period:
        available_pool = book_dep + accumulated_non_deductible
            (pool of current book dep + prior timing differences available for deduction)
        annual_cap = tax_rate × asset_cost_keur
        tax_dep = min(annual_cap, opening_tax_basis, available_pool)

        # Period timing difference (delta only, NOT accumulated pool):
        non_ded = max(0, book_dep - min(book_dep, tax_dep))

        # Accumulated pool: prior accumulated + book_dep - tax_dep
        # (can decrease when tax_dep > book_dep, reaches 0 when fully recovered)
        accumulated = max(0, prior_accumulated + book_dep - tax_dep)

        closing_basis = max(0, opening_basis - tax_dep)

    The "accumulated_non_deductible" is NOT a running sum — it represents the
    *current* excess of book depreciation over tax deductible depreciation
    that is still waiting to be recovered. When the tax cap is larger than
    the current book depreciation, the accumulated pool can be drawn down.

    For non-deductible assets:
        tax_dep = 0
        non_ded = book_dep (permanent, no reversal)
        accumulated = book_dep  (remains as permanent difference)
        closing_basis = opening_basis (no deduction ever taken)

    Notes
    -----
    - ``bonus_depreciation_pct`` not applied in this primitive.
    - The schedule can extend beyond the book depreciation period — after
      book_dep = 0, accumulated timing differences continue to be recovered
      until the tax basis is exhausted or the cap runs out.
    - ``closing_tax_basis`` cannot go negative.

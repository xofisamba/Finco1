"""Construction P&L Statement - determines initial tax loss carryforward.

During the construction period, certain costs are capitalized (not expensed)
and certain items may generate revenue. This creates a book vs. tax difference
that determines the initial tax loss carryforward into the operational phase.

Key items:
- IDC (Interest During Construction): capitalized, not deductible during construction
- Bank fees, commitment fees: capitalized as part of CAPEX
- Pre-operational OpEx: expensed but before COD
- Construction period revenue: any revenue generated before COD

The initial_tax_loss_keur from this statement is used by the waterfall engine
to properly model CIT timing - without it, CIT starts too early (Y1 instead of Y3).

class ConstructionPLStatement:
    """
    P&L statement for the construction period.

    Used to deterministically compute the initial tax loss carryforward
    that offsets EBT in early operational years, delaying CIT start.

    In Excel, this is implicitly handled via the "tax loss carryforward" schedule.
    In our model, we make it explicit and computed from construction financials.

    Example for Oborovo (18-month construction):
        IDC: ~1,169 kEUR (capitalized, depreciates after COD)
        Bank fees: ~300 kEUR (capitalized)
        Commitment fees: ~470 kEUR (already in CAPEX, not additional)
        Pre-operational OpEx: ~0 (no revenue before COD)
        Construction revenue: 0
        Initial tax loss: ~1,469 kEUR + construction period timing effects

    The 9,000 kEUR figure in the old code included construction-period interest
    that was capitalized in Excel but not tracked separately in our model.
    With this class, we explicitly model all construction-period financial effects.

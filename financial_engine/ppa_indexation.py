"""financial_engine.ppa_indexation — PPA tariff escalation policy.

Pure computation — no I/O, no project identity, no financial model state.

Three escalation policies:

FIRST_FULL_CALENDAR_YEAR_AS_BASE
    The first full calendar year following COD is index year zero.
    Escalation begins on 1 January of the year AFTER that base year.
    Example: COD = 29-Jun-2030 → base year = 2031 → first escalation 1-Jan-2032.

AFTER_FIRST_FULL_OPERATING_YEAR
    The first escalation occurs exactly one year after COD / operation start.
    Date-driven: each subsequent escalation on the COD anniversary.
    Example: COD = 29-Jun-2030 → first escalation 29-Jun-2031.

CONTRACT_ANNIVERSARY
    Escalation follows the anniversary of an explicit PPA / indexation start date.
    ppa_indexation_start_date is REQUIRED — callers must supply an explicit date.
    Example: COD = 29-Jun-2030, PPA start = 01-Oct-2030 → first escalation 01-Oct-2031.

Period-crossing convention
    The count of escalation events that have occurred is evaluated at the period END DATE.
    For FIRST_FULL_CALENDAR_YEAR_AS_BASE, indexation boundaries are 1 January, which coincide
    with semiannual period boundaries (June-30 / Dec-31 series) — no intra-period split required.
    For AFTER_FIRST_FULL_OPERATING_YEAR and CONTRACT_ANNIVERSARY, the indexation date is
    arbitrary and may fall inside a semiannual period. This module evaluates escalation at
    period_end and does NOT split the period. Callers requiring intra-period weighted revenue
    must implement that split themselves.

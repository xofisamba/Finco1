"""financial_engine.adapters.shl_inputs — ProjectInputs → ShlSchedulePolicy adapter (C3B3D1).

Maps canonical ProjectInputs.financing to ShlSchedulePolicy.

IMPORTANT: This adapter is NOT wired into orchestrator.py, waterfall_engine.py,
or any existing production path. It is adapter foundation only.
Production runtime wiring is deferred to C3B3D2.

Lineage notes:
  OBOROVO_SHL_BALANCE_LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED — construction → operating opening balance
      transition cannot be proven from committed source evidence alone. The adapter
      does NOT promote Oborovo or TUHO to the canonical schedule runtime.
  TUHO_SHL_BALANCE_LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED — same boundary status as Oborovo.

Payment mode status (C3B3D1_BLOCKED_PAYMENT_MODE_SEMANTICS):
  shl_pik_switch_period is defined in FinancingParams but is NOT consumed by any
  runtime code outside serialization. The legacy waterfall engine computes
  pik_switch_triggered at runtime from (cf_for_shl > shl_balance × shl_rate) —
  it does NOT read shl_pik_switch_period. Therefore shl_pik_switch_period=0 does
  not have a proven semantic mapping to CASH_PAID for every operating period.
  Payment mode derivation is fail-closed until D2 source evidence is established.

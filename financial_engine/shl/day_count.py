"""financial_engine.shl.day_count — Typed SHL day-count dispatch (C3B3D2B1).

SHL uses an INCLUSIVE end-date convention: the last calendar day of the period
counts as a full calendar day.  This differs from Senior Debt:

  Senior Debt (financial_engine.senior_debt.interest.period_day_fraction):
      days = (period_end - period_start).days          [exclusive end]
      dcf  = days / denominator

  SHL (this module):
      days = (period_end - period_start).days + 1      [inclusive end]
      dcf  = days / denominator

Do NOT unify these two implementations.  The date interval semantics are
different, and C3B3D2B0 proved the SHL inclusive convention against all 40
Oborovo operating periods to machine epsilon.  Any unification would silently
alter Senior Debt numeric behaviour.

The existing compute_shl_dcf_actual_365_inclusive() in waterfall.py is
governance-locked and unchanged.  compute_shl_dcf() delegates to it for
ACT_365_FIXED and implements ACT_360 with identical inclusive semantics.

Convention labels
-----------------
ACT_365_FIXED : SOURCE_PROVEN_FOR_OBOROVO_OPERATING_SHL
    Proven in C3B3D2B0 across all 40 operating periods.
    Max source-oracle delta: 1.11e-16 (machine epsilon).

ACT_360 : GENERIC_ENGINE_CAPABILITY
    Not source-proven for Oborovo SHL.  A generic calculation capability.

PERIOD_AXIS_ACTUAL_YEAR : GENERIC_ENGINE_CAPABILITY
    Actual days divided by the actual calendar-year denominator, segmented at
    year boundaries, with the same inclusive SHL date semantics.

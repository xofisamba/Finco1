"""Phase D1 — Depreciation Export / Audit Visibility Hardening.

This module ADDS audit visibility only. It does NOT enable any
depreciation feature flag, does NOT change depreciation
schedules, does NOT change tax / P&L / CFADS / payment schedule
values, and does NOT change waterfall runtime authority. It
writes a single "Depreciation Audit" sheet that discloses the
current depreciation source, runtime authority, and audit-only
surfaces.

All wording is review-safe and conservative: the sheet tells
the reviewer exactly which backend runtime path produced the
values that appear in the rest of the workbook. Reviewers can
use it to confirm that no canonical depreciation engine is
being silently promoted to runtime authority.

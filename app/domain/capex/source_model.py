CAPEX Source Model — isolated schema stubs.

This module defines the CAPEX source model and input schema design.
It is completely isolated from runtime model code — NOT imported by any
runtime calculation, construction, returns, or debt module.

Purpose: Provide type-safe schema definitions for CAPEX input wiring
(Phase 21E and beyond).

NOTE: Do not import this module from any runtime-capable module.
      It exists only for design/type-safe schema documentation.

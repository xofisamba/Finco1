"""Phase 25B Closure — Usability audit helper.

Pure read-side helper module. Computes a structured
audit of 8 first-time-finance-user workflows and
returns a ``UsabilityAudit`` dataclass with per-workflow
percentage readiness scores plus an overall weighted
score.

The helper is intentionally deterministic and reads
ONLY from a structured input payload describing which
features / surfaces are live in the codebase. It does
NOT call the persistence layer, does NOT inspect the
live HTTP layer, does NOT enumerate routes at runtime,
and does NOT inspect git history.

The input payload is built once at audit time by the
``build_audit_inputs`` function, which reads from the
filesystem (e.g. looks for the presence of known
partials, known helper modules, known test files).
The helper then scores the payload against the 8
workflow criteria.

The 8 workflows (from the user's 25B Closure brief):

1. Create project
2. Edit assumptions
3. Save
4. Run
5. Compare
6. Export
7. Understand outputs
8. Understand limitations

Each workflow is scored 0-100 based on the number of
supporting surfaces present in the input payload. The
overall score is the unweighted arithmetic mean of the
8 workflow scores (no double-counting of overlapping
features).

The helper does NOT:
- mutate any input
- call the persistence layer
- call services
- enable any feature flag
- change any runtime path
- touch construction / C10 / R-PAR / tax / debt / IDC
- touch rc1
- touch factory (TUHO / Oborovo)

It is a pure read-side audit / classifier.

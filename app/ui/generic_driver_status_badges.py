"""Phase P1-B + Phase S2 + Phase S3 — Generic Driver Status Badges / Metadata helpers.

Pure read-side helper module. Provides the driver
status vocabulary, badge class names, tooltip
copy, and the field-to-status mapping for the
Generic Solar / Wind input form.

This is the UI explanation layer that follows the
Phase P1-A driver-response audit, the Phase S2
gearing-as-output rule, and the Phase S3
driver-to-KPI binding suite. The helper does NOT
mutate any input, does NOT call the runtime, does
NOT change formulas.

Mapping (per PR #600 audit, branch f8ae191; refined
by Phase S2; refined again by Phase S3 binding
suite; refined once more by the S3 review fix
that split the sculpt-driver and timing-driver
concepts):

  WIRED (6 fields, no badge by default):
    - tariff_eur_mwh
    - p50_hours
    - capacity_mw
    - total_capex_keur
    - opex_y1_keur
    - ppa_term_years

  DSCR SCULPT DRIVER (3 fields, "DSCR sculpt driver"
    badge):
    - interest_rate_pct
    - tenor_years
    - target_dscr

  TIMING DRIVER (1 field, "Timing driver" badge, NEW
    in S3 review fix): this is a separate concept
    from the DSCR sculpt drivers. A timing driver
    is a model-affecting field that influences the
    construction-period timeline (and therefore
    equity_irr via financial_close timing), but
    does NOT change revenue, EBITDA, senior debt,
    or DSCR.
    - construction_months (moves equity_irr via
      the financial_close timeline by ~10bps
      spread between 6mo and 36mo construction
      periods, but does not move revenue, EBITDA,
      senior debt, or DSCR. Pre-S1 was
      METADATA_ONLY; the S1 schema extension
      accepts it; the resolver applies it via
      info override / financial_close timing.)

  REPORTING_DERIVED (1 field, Phase S2):
    - gearing_pct

  METADATA_ONLY: 0 fields (Phase S3 emptied this
    set)
  NOT_WIRED: 0 fields

Phase S2 amendment: gearing_pct is no longer labeled
as a DSCR sculpt driver. Under DSCR sculpt, the
sizing CFADS basis sizes senior debt to hit
target_dscr. gearing_pct is the user-supplied
indicative gearing assumption; the realized
gearing_ratio is a DERIVED OUTPUT computed as
senior_debt_keur / total_capex_keur. The user-facing
label is now "Indicative (derived)" with copy that
explains the relationship.

Phase S3 amendment: ppa_term_years moved out of
METADATA_ONLY. The S1 resolver added
_set_revenue_ppa_term, which applies
ppa_term_years to the revenue duration. Changing
ppa_term_years moves total_revenue_keur and
total_ebitda_keur. ppa_term_years is now WIRED.

Phase S3 review fix: construction_months is split
out of DSCR_SCULPT_DRIVER_FIELDS into a new
TIMING_DRIVER_FIELDS set. The previous S3 mapping
incorrectly grouped construction_months with the
3 binding sculpt drivers. The correct semantic is
that construction_months affects the
construction-period timing (and therefore
equity_irr by a small amount), but does not bind
senior debt, DSCR, revenue, or EBITDA. The 3 true
DSCR sculpt drivers (interest_rate_pct,
tenor_years, target_dscr) are kept in
DSCR_SCULPT_DRIVER_FIELDS with the "DSCR sculpt
driver" badge. construction_months gets a new
"Timing driver" badge with a separate CSS class
(badge-timing, soft amber palette) to make the
distinction visually clear.

CSS class reuse note: TIMING_DRIVER reuses the
existing badge-metadata and badge-dscr-sculpt CSS
classes internally for layout (border, padding,
font-size) but uses a new badge-timing class for
the color palette (soft amber) and a new
TOOLTIP_TIMING_DRIVER copy that explicitly
distinguishes it from the DSCR sculpt drivers.
The user-facing badge text is "Timing driver"
(never "DSCR sculpt driver").

"""Phase PR3 — Canonical Driver Taxonomy (single source of truth).

Phase PR3 establishes ONE canonical source of
truth for driver classification and sizing
terminology. Pre-PR3, the same vocabulary was
spread across:

  - ``app/ui/generic_driver_response_audit.py``
    (P1-A audit module, used WIRED_PARTIAL
    instead of DSCR_SCULPT_DRIVER)
  - ``app/ui/generic_driver_status_badges.py``
    (P1-B UI helper, used the full S2/S3
    vocabulary)
  - ``tests/test_phase_s1_*.py`` /
    ``tests/test_phase_s2_*.py`` /
    ``tests/test_phase_s3_*.py`` (per-phase
    binding / classification tests)

This module centralises:

  1. **CANONICAL_CATEGORIES** — the 6
     categories used across the codebase:

       - WIRED (fully model-affecting;
         moves revenue/EBITDA and/or IRR)
       - DSCR_SCULPT_DRIVER (binds senior
         debt / DSCR; IRR may not change)
       - TIMING_DRIVER (model-affecting via
         the construction-period timeline;
         moves equity_irr only, does NOT
         change revenue, EBITDA, senior debt,
         or DSCR)
       - REPORTING_DERIVED (user-supplied
         indicative assumption; the
         realised value is a derived output)
       - METADATA_ONLY (saved/displayed for
         context, not used by the runtime)
       - NOT_WIRED (no runtime binding; not
         on the active editable form)

  2. **CANONICAL_FIELD_MAPPING** — the 11
     editable Generic form fields and their
     canonical category.

  3. **Sizing terminology** — the
     ``EXCEL_METHODOLOGY`` constant
     (DSCR sculpt under the TUHO/Oborovo
     Excel workbooks) is distinguished from
     the ``APP_PARITY_STRATEGY`` constant
     (TUHO/Oborovo app paths are frozen
     Excel anchors / parity by construction;
     Generic Solar/Wind use the live DSCR
     sculpt path).

  4. **Explicitly NOT on this roadmap** —
     ``manual_gearing``, ``gearing cap``,
     and ``min(gearing cap, sculpt)`` are
     explicitly listed as NOT-ON-ROADMAP
     helpers so future agents do not
     re-introduce them.

This module is the single source of truth
that future tests, helpers, and UI surfaces
should reference. Existing per-phase modules
(P1-A, P1-B, S1, S2, S3) retain their own
vocabulary for backward compatibility, but
the canonical categories in this module
MUST stay aligned with the S3 binding
suite and the P1-B UI badges.

"""Phase 57A-9D — Run / materialization integration for
persisted CAPEX user-added sub-lines.

This module sits between the persistence layer
(``app.persistence.capex_sub_lines``) and the model layer
(``domain.inputs.CapexStructure``). Its single public
function, ``_apply_user_sub_lines_to_capex``, is the
canonical wire-up that the /run route calls in the
user-created path.

The 57A-9A design gate (PR #505) prescribes that user
sub-lines fold into the existing 15 named
``CapexItem.amount_keur`` fields via the locked
``CAPEX_CATEGORY_TO_FIELD`` mapping, with the scenario's
reserved-key overrides (``_capex_sub_line_overrides``)
applying on top. This module implements that wire-up
**without** touching the model formula path, the Excel
export, the UI, or the financial engine internals. It is
a pure materialization step on the model INPUT side: the
``CapexStructure`` is the input to the model, not the
output.

Hard rules (Phase 57A-9A design + 57A-9B Claude delta
review fix):

  - Factory projects (TUHO/Oborovo/Generic Solar/Generic
    Wind) have no user sub-lines. The helper returns the
    input ``capex`` unchanged. This is the TUHO/Oborovo
    parity guarantee.
  - User projects load active sub-lines from the
    ``capex_sub_lines`` table, keyed by ``project_id``.
    Soft-deleted rows are excluded.
  - Scenario override amount REPLACES project default
    amount (NOT a delta adjustment). This is the
    57A-9B Claude delta review fix, pinned by
    ``resolve_effective_sub_line_amount``.
  - Unknown ``sub_line_id`` overrides are ignored — the
    helper does not raise on stale override UUIDs. (A
    warning is logged so reviewers can see it, but the
    Run does not crash.)
  - Unknown parent categories raise ``ValueError``
    loudly. This is fail-fast: an unknown category
    would silently drop data, which the design gate
    explicitly forbids.
  - C.17 / C.18 are rejected at validation time (the
    57A-9B ``validate_parent_category`` helper). This
    module never receives them.
  - The 57A-8 in-memory preview rows (TMP markers) are
    NEVER loaded from the table — they are not persisted.
    This module only reads rows from
    ``capex_sub_lines``, which is the persisted table.

    uses the canonical ``get_cursor()`` context manager
    (Phase 53 persistence architecture). This guarantees:

    - One authoritative DB path source (``db.DB_PATH``
      / ``FINCO_DB_PATH`` env). No manual
      ``Path(__file__).parents[N]`` computation here.
    - Service runtime and persistence runtime stay

      path (env var, config, multi-tenant shim), the
      Run path sees the same DB the persistence layer
      does. No hidden divergence.
    - No hidden bug from a future refactor that moves

    This is the **explicit Run/materialization boundary**
    for Phase 57A-9D. The /run route in the user-created
    path calls this helper AFTER the project's
    ``ProjectInputs`` is built from the snapshot, and
    BEFORE the model is run.

    Args:
        capex: a ``CapexStructure`` (from
            ``domain.inputs``) for the project. This is
            the input to the model; the helper MAY
            return a new ``CapexStructure`` with selected
            field amounts updated.
        project_id: the ``projects.project_id`` (UUID) of
            the user project. Used to look up persisted
            sub-lines in the ``capex_sub_lines`` table.
            For factory / template-seeded projects (TUHO,
            Oborovo, Generic Solar, Generic Wind), this
            helper is NOT called — the factory no-op case
            is handled by the empty ``user_sub_lines``
            short-circuit in ``fold_sub_lines_into_capex``.
        scenario_overrides: the active scenario's
            ``overrides_json`` dict (or None for Base
            case). The reserved key
            ``_capex_sub_line_overrides`` carries the
            ``{sub_line_id: amount_keur}`` map.

    Returns:
        A ``CapexStructure``. For factory projects and
        projects with no sub-lines, the input is returned
        unchanged. For user projects with sub-lines, a
        new ``CapexStructure`` is returned with the
        field amounts updated.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if a persisted sub-line carries an
            unknown parent category (e.g. C.99). This is
            fail-fast: silent drop would corrupt the
            parity guarantee. The 57A-9B
            ``validate_parent_category`` rejects C.17 and
            C.18 at persistence time, so they never reach
            this helper.

    Notes:
        - The helper does NOT mutate the input
          ``CapexStructure`` (``CapexStructure`` is a
          frozen dataclass, so mutation is impossible).
        - The helper does NOT generate fake runtime IDs.
          Sub-lines carry the persisted ``sub_line_id``
          (UUID) which is the scenario-override key.
        - The helper does NOT include 57A-8 in-memory
          preview rows. Those are not persisted.
        - The helper does NOT touch the model formula
          path, the Excel export, the UI, or the
          waterfall engine. It is purely an input-
          materialization step.

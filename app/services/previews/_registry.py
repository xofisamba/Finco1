"""C2-PR29 — Preview Slice Registry.

Small in-process registry that maps a stable slice `name` to its
compute function and its `response_key` (the top-level JSON key it
populates in /model/preview's response body).

Three slices are registered today (in this exact, pinned order so
the response body's key insertion order is stable):

  1. operating  -> "operating"      (wrapped echo slices)
  2. debt       -> "debt"           (C2-PR24/25 backend-computed)
  3. tax        -> "tax"            (C2-PR30 backend stub)

The registry is intentionally NOT auto-discovery (`importlib` magic).
Every slice must be registered by an explicit `register(...)` call
in `app/services/model_preview.py` (the orchestration module) so
that:

  (a) the import order is unambiguous and traceable in code review,
  (b) tests can assert the exact set of registered slices,
  (c) a future module-rename accidentally missing one slice will
      cause a clear ImportError rather than a silent "missing
      preview" UX bug.

`run_all(context)` returns the merged response-body delta as a
dict, applying each registered slice in registration order. Slices
that return an empty dict (e.g. operating with no echo fields
present) contribute zero keys. The orchestrator (`build_preview_
response()`) merges this delta into the rest of the response body.

Forbidden: no I/O, no caching, no DB writes. Pure function of the
input `PreviewContext`. Verified by
tests/test_c2_pr28_30_tax_preview_stub.py::
TestRegistryPureAndDeterministic.

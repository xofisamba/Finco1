"""Phase 24A: Runtime Impact Taxonomy

Canonical4-state taxonomy for FincoGPT UI surfaces.
Replaces legacy runtime impact labels with standardized primary states.

Primary States
-------------
Drives model
    Input is runtime-effective and directly affects calculation outputs.
    User should understand changes alter model results.

Display only
    Field is visible/reference/displayed but does not currently affect
    runtime calculations. User should not expect formula impact.

Pending
    Field/section is planned or captured but not yet wired.
    Could become runtime-effective in a later phase.

Needs review
    Field/section has ambiguous mapping, unresolved source issue,
    validation concern, or requires human/model review before being trusted.

Sub-reasons (for tooltip/helper text, not primary labels)
---------------------------------------------------------
Timing only — field is used for construction timing/draw schedule only
Reference only   — field is shown for reference, not runtime-effective
Pending treatment — field is captured but treatment is pending
Pending runtime source — runtime source not yet connected
Not comparable — scope mismatch prevents comparison
Deferred — field is intentionally deferred
Not applicable — field does not apply to this project/scenario
Fixture-backed   — field value comes from a fixture CSV, not runtime solver
Frozen schedule  — field uses a frozen/scheduled value, not computed
Source locked     — source is locked (e.g., Excel calibration)
Validation warning — field has a validation concern
Excel parity known gap — known difference from Excel, documented

Legacy Mapping
--------------
Maps legacy labels to canonical primary states.

Legacy label -> Canonical state
------------------------- ------------------
"Drives model"            -> Drives model
"backend_authoritative"   -> Drives model
"app_mapped" + affects    -> Drives model
"Timing only"             -> Display only
"Reference only"          -> Display only
"Display only"           -> Display only
"Pending treatment"       -> Pending
"Pending runtime source"  -> Pending
"Deferred"                -> Pending
"Not applicable"          -> Display only
"Not comparable" -> Needs review
"Needs review"            -> Needs review
"mismatch"                -> Needs review
"Unknown"                 -> Needs review
"Pending runtime source"  -> Pending
"fixture-backed"          -> Drives model (with sub-reason)
"frozen schedule"         -> Drives model (with sub-reason)

Frozen Senior DS Treatment
--------------------------
TUHO and Oborovo senior debt schedule:
- Primary state: Drives model
- Sub-reason: "Fixture-backed frozen schedule"
- Do NOT claim solver/sculpting is active

CAPEX Treatment
---------------
CAPEX Phase 21 is display/schema only:
- C.16 Project Rights: Pending (not runtime-effective)
- M1-M18 schedule: Display only (timing-only, not IDC runtime)
- EPC/Grid totals (aggregate_total scope): Drives model
- C.16 children with treatment_resolved: Drives model

Tax Treatment
--------------
Actual runtime-effective tax fields: Drives model
Pending/future tax treatment: Pending or Needs review

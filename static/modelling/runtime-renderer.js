/*
 * Finco One — Live Modelling Layer
 * C2-PR8: First End-to-End Incremental Runtime Slice (client-side
 * RESPONSE RENDERER only — receives the JSON response from a real
 * POST /model/preview network call made elsewhere (see
 * static/modelling/live-model.js's flushScheduledRecalc()), validates
 * it defensively, and patches exactly ONE existing, NON-FINANCIAL
 * Overview status DOM element. This module never makes a network
 * call itself, never evaluates a financial formula, never calls Save
 * or Run, never touches persistence or export, and never throws.)
 *
 * Reference: docs/C2_PR1_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTE.md through
 *            docs/C2_PR7_BACKEND_PREVIEW_ENDPOINT_CONTRACT_STUB_NOTE.md,
 *            docs/C2_PR8_FIRST_RUNTIME_SLICE.md.
 *
 * Ownership: window.FcRuntimeRenderer is a new, standalone module —
 * like FcDependencyGraph (C2-PR4), FcRecalcExecutor (C2-PR5), and
 * FcRecalcPreview (C2-PR6/PR7), deliberately not folded into
 * FcLiveModel. It owns no dirty-state, scheduler, dependency-graph, or
 * execution state of any kind — it is a pure, stateless DOM-patching
 * consumer of a server response object it is handed by its caller.
 *
 * Input contract: render(responseBody) where responseBody is expected
 * to be shaped like the POST /model/preview JSON response (see
 * main_web.py's model_preview() route / docs/C2_PR7_*.md /
 * docs/C2_PR8_FIRST_RUNTIME_SLICE.md), in particular:
 *   {
 *     ok: true,
 *     ...,
 *     overview: { runtime_status: "<string>", updated: <boolean> }
 *   }
 * `render()` NEVER throws, for any input, including `null`/
 * `undefined`/a non-object/a malformed `overview` field/a response
 * with `ok: false`/a response from a network error path (the caller
 * is expected to pass `null` or an error-shaped object on fetch
 * failure — see live-model.js). On anything that doesn't validate, it
 * is a safe no-op: it does not touch the DOM at all, and the existing
 * status text is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * Output: returns a small diagnostic result object
 *   { rendered: <boolean>, reason: <string> }
 * for callers/tests that want to confirm what happened, but this
 * return value is informational only — nothing in this module's own
 * logic depends on a caller reading it.
 *
 * DOM contract: patches exactly one existing element,
 * #overview-runtime-status-value (inside the always-rendered
 * #overview-runtime-status status region in
 * app/templates/partials/workspace_shell.html's Overview tab). This
 * element holds a plain runtime STATUS string (e.g. "Preview
 * executed"), never an IRR/DSCR/revenue/tax/other real KPI number —
 * deliberately chosen so this slice can never be mistaken for a real
 * recalculation having occurred. If the element is not present in the
 * DOM (e.g. an isolated test fixture, or a future page that doesn't
 * render the Overview tab), this is a safe no-op.
 *
 * C2-PR10: additionally, when the response body carries a "capex"
 * field ({ capex_total_preview: <number>, currency: "EUR" }), this
 * module ALSO patches a second, separate, always-rendered element,
 * #capex-total-preview-value (inside #capex-total-preview, next to —
 * never replacing or relabelling — the C2-PR8 runtime status
 * indicator). This is the first and only real numeric value this
 * whole runtime path is allowed to render anywhere: a plain CAPEX
 * line-item SUM of the live, unsaved CAPEX grid, computed entirely
 * client-side (static/modelling/recalc-preview.js) and merely echoed
 * back by the server — never a real financial-engine output, and
 * never confused with the saved/Run-derived Total CAPEX figure shown
 * elsewhere on the CAPEX sheet. Missing/malformed "capex" is a safe
 * no-op for this part only — it never clears or invalidates a
 * previously-rendered overview status, and a missing/malformed
 * "overview" field never blocks rendering a present, valid "capex"
 * field (the two are rendered independently). See
 * docs/C2_PR10_CAPEX_TOTAL_PREVIEW.md.
 *
 * C2-PR14: a third independent additive patch, mirroring the C2-PR10/
 * PR13 capex/revenue patches exactly — when the response body carries
 * an "opex" field ({ preview: <number>, currency: "EUR" }), this module
 * ALSO patches #opex-total-preview-value. See docs/C2_PR14_OPEX_PREVIEW.md.
 *
 * C2-PR15: a fourth independent additive patch — when the response
 * body carries an "ebitda" field ({ preview: <number|null>, currency:
 * "EUR" }), this module ALSO patches #ebitda-preview-value. EBITDA is
 * never computed here — it arrives already-computed (see
 * static/modelling/recalc-preview.js's _computeEbitdaFromPreviews and
 * docs/C2_PR15_EBITDA_PREVIEW.md for the client-side-computation
 * choice). A null/absent ebitda.preview is a safe no-op for this patch
 * only, exactly like a missing "capex"/"revenue"/"opex" field.
 *
 * C2-PR16: a fifth independent additive patch — when the response body
 * carries an "operating_cash_flow" field ({ preview: <number|null>,
 * currency: "EUR" }), this module ALSO patches
 * #operating-cf-preview-value. *** THIS VALUE IS NOT AUTHORITATIVE
 * OPERATING CASH FLOW *** — it is EBITDA Preview passed through
 * verbatim, with no debt/tax/depreciation/financing adjustment, solely
 * to prove the preview pipeline can chain a preview of a preview of
 * previews. See docs/C2_PR16_OPERATING_CF_PREVIEW.md.
 *
 * C2-PR11 (Runtime Preview UX Polish): the previous binary Idle/
 * "Preview executed" status text is replaced with an explicit 5-state
 * machine — Idle, "Preview updating…", "Preview ready", "Preview
 * unavailable", "Preview failed" — driven by THREE new, additive,
 * non-throwing entry points this module exposes for the request
 * lifecycle's caller (static/modelling/live-model.js) to call at the
 * appropriate moment:
 *
 *   - setUpdating()    — call right before a preview fetch is issued.
 *   - setUnavailable() — call when there is nothing to preview yet
 *                        (e.g. a flush produced no previewPayload, no
 *                        dirty cells, or fetch/FcRecalcPreview isn't
 *                        available) instead of issuing a fetch at all.
 *   - setFailed(seq)   — call from the fetch's .catch()/non-2xx branch.
 *
 * `render(body)` itself becomes the "success" transition (-> "Preview
 * ready"), and is UNCHANGED in its own validation/patch logic — it
 * still patches `#overview-runtime-status-value`'s text to whatever
 * `body.overview.runtime_status` says (still just a status string,
 * still never a financial value) and `#capex-total-preview-value`'s
 * text/badge class to the formatted CAPEX sum, independently, exactly
 * as before. C2-PR11 only adds the explicit state machine bookkeeping
 * (the `data-c2pr11-runtime-state` attribute, the `aria-busy`
 * attribute on the two parent `.runtime-status-indicator` elements,
 * and the `#…-sr` visually-hidden announcement spans) around the
 * existing patches — it does not change what triggers a render or what
 * value gets rendered on success.
 *
 * CRITICAL invariant carried over from C2-PR9's staleness guard,
 * restated here because it is this PR's most safety-critical
 * correctness rule: a `setFailed()` call (or any other non-success
 * state transition) must NEVER blank, reset, or otherwise touch the
 * last successfully-rendered VALUE text of either
 * `#overview-runtime-status-value` or `#capex-total-preview-value` —
 * it only ever changes the STATE label/attributes layered on top of
 * whatever value is already displayed. Only a genuinely newer
 * successful `render()` call is ever allowed to replace a displayed
 * value. `setFailed()`/`setUnavailable()`/`setUpdating()` are pure
 * state-label transitions; they never write to either `__value`
 * element's `textContent` at all — they only touch
 * `data-c2pr11-runtime-state`/`aria-busy`/the `#…-sr` announcement
 * text. The caller (`live-model.js`) is responsible for the existing
 * C2-PR9 sequence-token check that already gates whether a given
 * response is even allowed to reach `render()`/`setFailed()` at all
 * for a given request; this module does not re-implement or weaken
 * that guard — it is a pure consumer of "the caller has already
 * decided this is the response for the newest request."
 *
 * See docs/C2_PR11_PREVIEW_UX_POLISH.md for the full state machine
 * (all 5 states, every valid transition, and exactly what triggers
 * each).
 *
 * This module does NOT:
 *   - make any network/AJAX/htmx call of any kind
 *   - evaluate any formula or call app/waterfall_core.py, domain/*,
 *     or any other financial code
 *   - call Save, Run, or any backend endpoint other than reading the
 *     response object it is handed
 *   - mutate FcLiveModel dirty state, the recalc scheduler,
 *     FcDependencyGraph's registry, or FcRecalcExecutor/FcRecalcPreview
 *     state
 *   - touch any other DOM element, KPI value, or persistence/export
 *     surface

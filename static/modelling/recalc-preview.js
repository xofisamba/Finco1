/*
 * Finco One — Live Modelling Layer
 * C2-PR6: Incremental Recalculation Preview Boundary (infrastructure
 * only — a deterministic, client-only payload BUILDER describing what
 * a FUTURE backend preview/recalc endpoint would need to receive; this
 * module never calls that endpoint, never makes any network request,
 * never evaluates a formula, never mutates the DOM, and never mutates
 * any dirty-state/recalc-scheduler/dependency-graph/execution state
 * owned by FcLiveModel/FcDependencyGraph/FcRecalcExecutor)
 *
 * C2-PR10: adds exactly one additive, opt-in computation — a CAPEX
 * total PREVIEW (a plain sum of the live, possibly-unsaved CAPEX grid
 * cell values currently in the DOM). This is the first PR in the
 * entire C1/C2 chain allowed to perform any real numeric computation,
 * and it is deliberately scoped to nothing more than "sum the editable
 * CAPEX amount cells currently visible in the browser." It does NOT
 * call app/waterfall_core.py, domain/*, or any other financial engine
 * code, client- or server-side. See
 * docs/C2_PR10_CAPEX_TOTAL_PREVIEW.md for the full design rationale
 * (in particular: why this sum is computed CLIENT-SIDE from
 * FcGridRegistry/FcCellIO rather than sent to the server to be
 * summed there).
 *
 * Reference: docs/C2_PR1_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTE.md,
 *            docs/C2_PR2_DIRTY_STATE_UNIFICATION_NOTE.md,
 *            docs/C2_PR3_RECALC_SCHEDULER_FOUNDATION_NOTE.md,

 *
 * This module answers exactly one question: "given a flushed recalc
 * snapshot and its (stubbed) execution result, what request payload
 * WOULD a future backend preview/recalc call need?" It only BUILDS
 * that payload as a plain-data object; it never sends it anywhere.
 *
 * Ownership: window.FcRecalcPreview is a new, standalone module —
 * like FcDependencyGraph (C2-PR4) and FcRecalcExecutor (C2-PR5),
 * deliberately not folded into FcLiveModel. It owns exactly one piece
 * of state: the most recently built payload (`_lastPreviewPayload`),
 * exposed via getLastPreviewPayload()/clearLastPreviewPayload(). It
 * never reads or writes FcLiveModel's dirty state directly, never
 * computes a dependency mapping, and never performs or duplicates any
 * execution logic — it only reads the `snapshot`/`execution` objects
 * it is handed.
 *
 * Input contract:
 *   buildPreviewPayload(snapshot, execution, options)
 *   - snapshot: shaped like
 *     { grids: [{gridId, addrs: [...]}], projectDirty, affectedGroups: [...] }
 *     (i.e. exactly what FcLiveModel.flushScheduledRecalc() produces,
 *     before or after FcRecalcExecutor.execute() is called).
 *   - execution: shaped like FcRecalcExecutor.execute()'s result
 *     ({status, executed, affectedGroups, dirtyCells, reason}), or any
 *     subset thereof, or omitted/null.
 *   - options: optional; reserved for future use (currently unused
 *     beyond defensive handling — no required fields).
 *   Never throws on malformed/missing snapshot or execution — both
 *   degrade to the safest possible payload rather than raising.
 *
 * Output contract: a deterministic, plain-data payload object:
 *   {
 *     valid: true | false,
 *     dirtyCells: [...sorted, deduplicated fully-qualified "gridId!key"
 *                  strings, derived the same way FcRecalcExecutor
 *                  derives its own dirtyCells field],
 *     affectedGroups: [...sorted, deduplicated group strings, preferring
 *                      execution.affectedGroups when present, falling
 *                      back to snapshot.affectedGroups],
 *     projectDirty: <boolean, from snapshot.projectDirty, default false>,
 *     reason: <string, from execution.reason if present, else
 *              options.reason if present, else "manual-flush">,
 *     executionStatus: <string from execution.status, or null if no
 *                       execution object was supplied/it was malformed>,
 *     project: <string project code from window.location's "project"
 *               query parameter, or null if unavailable — see metadata
 *               handling below; never fabricated>
 *   }
 * No timestamp, session id, or other non-reproducible field appears
 * anywhere in the payload. Two logically-equal (snapshot, execution)
 * pairs — however differently ordered their underlying grids/addrs/
 * groups arrays are — always produce deep-equal payloads.
 *
 * Metadata handling decision: the ONLY project/scenario identifier
 * available anywhere in the existing client without inventing new
 * server-rendered markup is the "project" query-string parameter
 * already present on every production workspace URL (confirmed via
 * tests/test_c2_pr5_recalc_executor_browser.py's fixture:
 * `page.goto(f"{live_server}/?project={project_code}", ...)`, and via
 * grepping app/templates/partials for the many `data-project-code`
 * attributes scattered across narrower partials — none of which are
 * guaranteed to be present/rendered on every workspace page, unlike
 * the URL itself). This module reads it defensively from
 * `window.location.search` via the global URLSearchParams
 * constructor (already used elsewhere in this codebase, e.g.
 * static/app.js's `new URLSearchParams(new FormData(form))` calls);
 * if it's missing, empty, or `window`/`window.location` is somehow
 * unavailable (e.g. a non-browser test harness), `project` is set to
 * `null` — never fabricated, never defaulted to a placeholder string.
 * No scenario identifier is included: no reliable, always-rendered
 * scenario id signal was found in the existing DOM/URL that isn't
 * scoped to a single narrow partial (e.g. scenario_tab.html's
 * data-active-scenario-id, which isn't present on every tab), so this
 * PR omits it entirely rather than reading a possibly-absent element
 * and guessing.
 *
 * This module does NOT:
 *   - evaluate any formula or call app/waterfall_core.py, domain/*,
 *     or any other financial code
 *   - make any network/AJAX/htmx call of any kind, to any endpoint,
 *     ever (this is the single most safety-critical invariant of this
 *     module — it only BUILDS a payload, it never transmits it)
 *   - call Save, Run, or any backend endpoint
 *   - mutate FcLiveModel dirty state, the recalc scheduler,
 *     FcDependencyGraph's (stateless) registry, or FcRecalcExecutor's
 *     last-execution state
 *   - touch the DOM or any rendered KPI/output value
